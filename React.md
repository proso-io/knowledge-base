Hello World!

React has revolutionized how we write web applications. According to the [Stack Overflow developer survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019) 2019, React is the 2nd most popular web framework (2nd after jQuery) and the most loved web framework amongst developers. This creates a strong incentive to learn React and start to become what people might call a "React developer".

A lot of people are beginning to do this but we strongly recommend against it. 

> Don't become a React developer, become a JavaScript developer who also knows React. 

This has been said several times by several great people simply because React introduces a lot of abstraction into the web development process, so much so that its easy to forget where browsers are today and how to write a simple web app without React. 

If you don't know basic JavaScript, please first start there, you will need to know it anyway. It should only take you around an hour to get a hang of it, it has a very straight-forward syntax.


Introduction to JavaScript is here - https://github.com/proso-io/knowledge-base/blob/master/JavaScript.md

Okay, on to React! The most fundamental tutorial on React can be found on the React website itself. It has a nice balance between theory and practice and so we would highly recommend it. 

Here's where you can find it - https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html

Try following this along down to the last step. To be able to do the tasks in the project, you should know the following - 

1. Creating components in React
2. React Props - how to pass data to components
3. State - what it is and how to update it
4. What's a `render` function

This should be a couple of hours of effort after which you should be ready to take on a React based task. This will not answer all your questions on how things are working under the hood and we will definitely answer that in adjacent knowledge docs that dive deeper into different areas of React. For now, enjoy the React process, get the hang of component-driven development and get your hands dirty.
