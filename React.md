Hello World!

React has revolutionized how we write web applications. According to the [Stack Overflow developer survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019) 2019, React is the 2nd most popular web framework (2nd after jQuery) and the most loved web framework amongst developers. This creates a strong incentive to learn React and start to become what people might call a "React developer".

A lot of people are beginning to do this but we strongly recommend against it. 

> Don't become a React developer, become a JavaScript developer who also knows React. 

This has been said several times by several great people simply because React introduces a lot of abstraction into the web development process, so much so that its easy to forget where browsers are today and how to write a simple web app without React. 

If you don't know basic JavaScript, please first start there, you will need to know it anyway. It should only take you around an hour to get a hang of it, it has a very straight-forward syntax.
