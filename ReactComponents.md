**P.S.** The React knowledge doc is a precursor to this doc. Find it here - https://github.com/proso-io/knowledge-base/blob/master/React.md


This doc will particularly focus on React components. With Proso.io, this concept is critical to understand since tasks can only be done asynchronously when the task boundaries are clearly defined. Adopting React requires a mental shift of thinking in components. The goal is to find units within the UI that can be pulled together into a components and reused wherever needed. 

The official React site has a good article on this here - https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html


After reading this article, you should be able to answer the following - 

1. Do React components really exist for the browser? In other words, when the HTML is rendered in the DOM, is there any notion of a React component? 
2. Why should props be read-only?
3. Assume you have a "Form" component within which is a "button" component. How will the button component communicate that it has been clicked to its parent "Form" component?


Discuss your thoughts on this the Slack community. I (Saumitra) would love to know what you think.
