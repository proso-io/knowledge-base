Hello World!


So, for a long time, people wrote CSS and it was all - hey CSS is painful, gotta live with it. While web development was getting better, CSS was pretty much the way it has always been. 

SCSS changed that. It provided things that we've all gotten used to, with a full programming language.

Its an abstraction however, and we should remember that. CSS is still just as it used to be. And browsers still only support CSS. SCSS is just a layer on top of CSS that makes it easier for us to manage our styling.

We will set up our project in such a way that the scss folder gets compiled to a css folder in the build process. The generated CSS file will be included in the final app page.

For the tasks, this guide should cover everything you need to know -

Following are the things you should be familiar with after going through the content above - 

- How to create variables
- How to create mixins
- How are import SCSS files in other files
- Nesting of CSS
