Hello World!

CSS is like makeup to HTML, everyone knows that. It’s an incredibly hard thing to master because it is so easy to just go with it. But, let’s not worry about it yet. For now, let’s get familiar with the basics of CSS, how rules are structured, how selectors are written and we can go in depth later.

Writing selectors for CSS is a huge topic and it gets asked a lot in front-end dev interviews. The following video will get you set up with the basics.

If you like text, this MDN page will get you set up quite nicely too -

Here’s what you should be able to do to be ready for CSS tasks in the projects - 

You should be able to select HTML elements and apply CSS to them.

You should be familiar with the following properties - 
- Color
- Background
- Position
- Display - ignore “flex” for now, we will have a full doc on it.
- Font 
- Font-weight
- Text-align
- Margin - especially “auto”
- Padding
- Float


To try things out, just take your favorite webpage and mess it up on your local session. Open up your developer console, select elements and apply random CSS to them. 

Here are some silly ideas from the Introduction to HTML doc that you can use here too, to make things look better.


- Create a webpage that shows a digital watch with fixed time in a huge font and says below that - “this clock shows the correct time exactly two times a day” (silly ideas I told you), then share this with your friends.
- Find a joke / quote you love and put it up in a formatted way on your webpage. Then, share this webpage with your friends. 
- Put up an empty textbox on your webpage. Below it, write the text - “this textbox does not record any information you put in. Go ahead and rant. Put all your frustrations in. This input field does not judge. It’s a fantastic listener.” Then share this link with your friends.
- Try to create a meme. Have the joke text in top and bottom and an image in the middle.
