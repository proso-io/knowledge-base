<span class="c4">Strap on your seatbelts because things are going to get real crazy now!</span>

<span class="c4"></span>

<span class="c4">JS uncovers a whole new world of possibilities. You can interact with your audience, you can augment their experience, basically it is that thing that is making the web what it is today.</span>

<span class="c4"></span>

<span class="c4"></span>

<span class="c4">Okay so where do you start? First, we will go over the syntax and then go into its most common usage. The most fundamental way in which JS is used is to manipulate the DOM. Let’s start there.</span>

<span class="c4"></span>

## <span class="c7">Basic Syntax</span>

<span class="c4"></span>

<span class="c4">I made a quick video on the basics of JS, feel free to check it out for a quick refresher on the syntax.</span>

## <span class="c7">DOM Manipulation</span>

<span class="c4"></span>

<span>P.S.</span> <span class="c9">[Introduction to CSS](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/a/proso.io/open?id%3D1AeDEuDjLaW1UPvJaSsNrOKAm5H_QnKEa8AuBdpQArLY&sa=D&ust=1556068477988000)</span><span class="c4"> is a prerequisite to this content.</span>

<span class="c4"></span>

<span class="c4">P.P.S. This step will take time. So, brace yourself and remember - what one fool can, another can. :)</span>

<span class="c4"></span>

<span>Let’s try building a game where we count number of times someone clicked on a button within a 10 seconds window. The highest scorer wins. I have written some part of that code so it partly works, you need to fill up the function</span> <span class="c8">moveButtonAround.</span> <span>The</span> <span class="c8">getRandomInt</span><span> function will return you a random number between two given limits. You can use that to move the button around.</span><span class="c4"> Check out the code here -</span>

<span class="c4"></span>

<span class="c4">Go to the file “script.js” and notice how the content is structured. Now, of course there is syntax that you might not be familiar with yet but the best way to learn it is to just dive in. Make the game work end-to-end and share your results with us. We will all play it and see who gets the highest score!</span>

<span class="c3"></span>

<span class="c3">Please hit the “Remix Project” button so that you don’t edit the base code. This will let other people to work with the code too.</span>

<span class="c4"></span>

<span class="c4">Working on this project will give you enough context to start contributing to the project tasks. So, congratulations! You have arrived. :)</span>
