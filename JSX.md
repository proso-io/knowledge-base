**P.S.** The React knowledge doc is a pre-cursor to this, check it out here - https://github.com/proso-io/knowledge-base/blob/master/React.md

Okay, so JSX isn't that big a deal from a complexity perspective - its quite simple to understand but it has a huge impact on the React development process. It makes us developers' life so much easier! 

Much like the core React tutorial, the JSX tutorial on the React site is gold. It nicely shows you the abstraction that React creates with JSX and what it really does under the hood. 

Check it out here - https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html

After going through this tutorial, you should be able to answer the following - 

1. Can we write React application without JSX? Can you quickly write a small React component without JSX and see if it works?
2. Does JSX need React? Can we invent a new web framework and use JSX with it? In other words, do we HAVE to use React to use JSX? If not, how would that work? 

Discuss your thoughts on this the Slack community. I (Saumitra) would love to know what you think.
