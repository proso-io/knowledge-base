Hello World!

Awesome to have you here! HTML will take you exactly half an hour to catch hold of. There really isn’t much to it. I would go to the extent of saying, there isn’t much to anything. :)

Please try out your ideas here  -

This will give you a playground to immediately get started with zero setup and also share your workspace with any of your mentors or peers if you run into problems.

Here is a beginner friendly doc that introduces you to HTML and how it is structured in general -

Key to catching hold of this - get your hands dirty. Try out a quick webpage. 

Here are some silly ideas to make this a bit more interesting (about me pages are so boring) - 

- Create a webpage that shows a digital watch with fixed time in a huge font and says below that - “this clock shows the correct time exactly two times a day” (silly ideas I told you), then share this with your friends.
- Find a joke / quote you love and put it up in a formatted way on your webpage. Then, share this webpage with your friends. 
- Put up an empty textbox on your webpage. Below it, write the text - “this textbox does not record any information you put in. Go ahead and rant. Put all your frustrations in. This input field does not judge. It’s a fantastic listener.” Then share this link with your friends.
- Try to create a meme. Have the joke text in top and bottom and an image in the middle.


Don’t worry if you are starting small. No front-end developer knows all tags or even uses them on a day to day basis. Everyone googles. So, don’t worry if you don’t remember the tags. Just take the gist and have fun :)
